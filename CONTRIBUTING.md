# Contribution Guidelines

Please read this guide if you're interested in contributing to Prisma.

**We welcome any form of contribution, especially from new members of our community** ðŸ’š

## Discussions

**Our community is a safe and friendly environment, where we support and treat each other with respect**.

We invite you to actively participate in discussions on Github, [the Forum](https://www.graph.cool/forum/) and [Slack](https://slack.graph.cool).

You'll see many discussions about usage or design questions, but any topic is welcome.
They are a great foundation to find potential issues, feature requests or documentation improvements.

## Issues

To report a bug, you can use [this template](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma/issues/new?template=bug.md).

New bug reports require to be triaged. Oftentimes this includes creating a minimal reproduction, or verifying that the problem still occurs on the latest stable version or the unstable channel (see below).

When you're starting to look into fixing a bug, create a WIP PR that you mention in the original issue. This way, we ensure that everyone interested can share their thoughts, and duplicate work is prevented.

Adding tests is a great way to help preventing future bugs.

## Documentation

You can either improve existing content or add new resources.

If you miss a particular information in [the reference documentation](https://www.prismagraphql.com/docs), feel free to either create an issue or PR. We also welcome [tutorials](https://www.prismagraphql.com/docs/tutorials/) for related topics that you're interested in. If you come across an interesting pattern, feel free to add a new example [to our example list](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma/tree/master/examples)!

## The Unstable Channel

Running against the unstable channel in your development or staging environment is a great way to help out. This way you can benefit from features before they are released on the stable channel, and help detect bugs or performance issues.

Note that when running the unstable channel, you might encounter unexpected behaviour.
Therefore, make sure to run a local backup using `prisma export` before, to stay on the safe side.

Checking out the unstable channel locally is as easy as this:

```
npm install -g prisma@beta
prisma local upgrade
```

Let us know if you encounter any problems on the unstable channel or help improving the documentation for upcoming features!

## Features

To request a new feature, you can use [this template](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

To contribute features or API changes, it's best to start a discussion in an issue first, ideally with a proposal. This allows everyone to participate and ensures that no potential implementation work is in vain.
