## Overview

### Prisma CLI

You can get access to the latest beta release of the Prisma CLI by appending the `@beta`-tag when installing it via NPM:

```
npm install -g prisma@beta
```

### Prisma server (Docker)

You can find the latest beta Prisma Docker image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prismagraphql/prisma/tags/). To use the latest version of a Prisma server, you need to configure the `image` property in your Docker Compose file accordingly by appending `-beta` to the the version number, e.g.:

<Code lines="4">

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.21-beta
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        managementApiSecret: __YOUR_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET__
        port: __YOUR_PRISMA_SERVER_PORT__
        databases:
          default:
            connector: __YOUR_DATABASE_CONNECTOR__
            migrations: __ENABLE_DB_MIGRATIONS__
            host: __YOUR_DATABASE_HOST__
            port: __YOUR_DATABASE_PORT__
            user: __YOUR_DATABASE_USER__
            password: __YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD__
```

</Code>

You can also pull the latest beta version directly using the Docker CLI:

```bash
docker pull prismagraphql/prisma:1.21-beta
```

## 1.21-beta: Mongo DB

With the `1.21-beta`-release, Prisma introduces a database connector for [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### 1. Setup

Install the latest version of the Prisma CLI using the instructions [above](#prisma-cli) and run the following command to initialize a new Prisma service:

```
prisma init hello-mongo
```

This launches the interactive wizard that helps you configure Prisma. To test the Mongo connector, you need to select the following answers for the first two questions:

- **Create new database**
- **MongoDB**

As a last step in the wizard, you need to select your preferred language for the Prisma client.

The Prisma CLI now created a `hello-mongo` directory for you which contains your project setup. The Docker Compose file is used to launch a Prisma server that's backed by a MongoDB. Navigate into the project directory and run the following command to start the Prisma server:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

> Note: This might throw an error if you already have Prisma Docker containers running locally. In that case, you can [reset your Docker containers](rty1-hard-resetting-the-docker-environment).

You can verify that the Docker containers for Prisma and for your MongoDB have been started correctly by running `docker ps`. This should print something similar to this:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                             COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES
5f3d8cc20699        mongo:3.6                         "docker-entrypoint.s…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp   hello-mongo_mongo_1
fc261a149740        prismagraphql/prisma:1.21-beta    "/bin/sh -c /app/sta…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:4466->4466/tcp     hello-mongo_prisma_1
```

### 2. Configuring the datamodel

The MongoDB connector uses different datamodel [directives](knul#sdl-directives) than the existing database connectors.
