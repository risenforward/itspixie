# Overview

The Graphcool is the main tool to manage your Graphcool projects. Generally, the shape and contents of a Graphcool project are determined by the [project definition](!alias-opheidaix3#project-configuration-yaml) file.

The CLI offers tools to modify the local version of your project definition and file structure as well as syncing these changes with remote projects in your Graphcool account.
