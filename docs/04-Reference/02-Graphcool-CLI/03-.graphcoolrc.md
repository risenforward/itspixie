# Targets, Clusters & `.graphcoolrc`

When using Graphcool, you can configure different _targets_ to which you can deploy your services.

A target is a _deployed instance_ of a Graphcool service. It is composed of two major components:

- A **cluster** that determines the infrastructure and runtime environment for the service. This could be a locally running Graphcool Docker cluster or a shared cluster from the Graphcool Backend-as-a-Service.
- A **service ID** that's generated by Graphcool when the target is created.  

Targets can be used to separate different _stages_ for your service and are managed through the `.graphcoolrc` files.

## `.graphcoolrc`

All your targets and clusters are managed through `.graphcoolrc` files. There are two major versions of `.graphcoolrc`:

- The **global** version of `.graphcoolrc` that's stored in your home directory. This is used for _global_ Graphcool configurations, such as cluster definitions or storing your platform token. 
- Several **local** versions of `.graphcoolrc` in your service directories. These are used to specify and manage targets for the corresponding service.
