description: Graphcool provides an automatically generated CRUD API for your data model. It also offers a realtime API using GraphQL subscriptions and a dedicated API for file management.

# Overview

The basic idea of Graphcool, and in particular its [GraphQL engine](thei2kephu#graphql-engine), is to provide an automatically generated CRUD API based on a data model that you specify for your project. This API further contains capabilities for filtering, ordering and pagination.

Each Graphcool project further comes with a realtime API that's based on GraphQL subscriptions and allows to react to _events_ that are hapenning inside the GraphQL engine.

Notice that every Graphcool project by default comes with two different APIs:

- **Simple API**: Intuitive CRUD operations and data modelling
- **Relay API**: Adheres to the schema requirements of Relay
