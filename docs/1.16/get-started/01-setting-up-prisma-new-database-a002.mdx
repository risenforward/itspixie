}

## Goals

On this page, you will learn how to:

- Install the Prisma CLI
- Start a local Prisma server using Docker
- Create a Prisma service configuration
- Deploy a Prisma service to the local Prisma server
- Read and write data using the Prisma Client

## Install the Prisma CLI

The [Prisma CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma) is used to deploy and manage Prisma services. You can install it using NPM:

```bash copy
npm install -g prisma
```

## Install Docker

To use Prisma locally, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker yet, you can download the Docker Community Edition for your operating system [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

## Set up database and Prisma server

### Create Docker Compose file

To launch a Prisma server on your machine, you need a [Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) that configures the Prisma server and specifies the database it can connect to.

```bash copy
touch docker-compose.yml
```

### Add Prisma and database Docker images

Paste the following contents into the Docker Compose file you just created:

<Code languages={["MySQL", "PostgreSQL"]}>

```yml copy
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.16
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: mysql
            host: mysql
            port: 3306
            user: root
            password: prisma
            migrations: true
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: prisma
    volumes:
      - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
  mysql:
```

```yml copy
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.16
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: postgres
            host: postgres
            port: 5432
            user: prisma
            password: prisma
            migrations: true
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: prisma
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: prisma
    volumes:
      - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  postgres:
```

</Code>


> You can switch between **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL8** by using the tabs above the code block.

### Start database and Prisma server

To start the Prisma server and launch the connected database, run the following command:

```bash copy
docker-compose up -d
```

## Create a Prisma service

To bootstrap the service configuration files for your first Prisma service, create a new directory and initalize it using the `prisma init` command:

```bash copy
mkdir hello-world
cd hello-world
prisma init --endpoint http://localhost:4466
```

When the interactive wizard launches, choose the suggested values when it asks you for the language and output directory of the generated Prisma Client.

## Deploy the Prisma service

The `prisma init` command created the _minimal_ service configuration needed to deploy a Prisma service: `prisma.yml` and `datamodel.graphql`. 

This service configuration now needs to be _deployed_ so you can use the Prisma API of your service:

```bash copy
prisma deploy
```

## Prepare Node application

Run the following command to create an empty Node script:

```bash copy
touch index.js
```

Next, initialize an empty NPM project in the current directory and add the `prisma-lib` dependency:

```bash copy
npm init -y
npm install prisma-lib --save
```

## Read and write data using the Prisma Client

Now type the following code in `index.js` and save it afterwards:

```js copy
const { Prisma } = require('./prisma')

const prisma = new Prisma()

async function main() {

  // Create a new user called `Alice`
  const newUser = await prisma.createUser({ name: 'Alice' })
  console.log(`Created new user: ${newUser.name} (ID: ${newUser.id})`)

  // Read all users from the database and print them to the console
  const allUsers = await prisma.users()
  console.log(allUsers)
}

main()
```

Execute the script with the following command:

```bash copy
node index.js
```

Whenever you run this script with that command, a new user record is created in the database (because of the call to `prisma.createUser()`). 

Feel free to play around with the Prisma Client API and try out some of the following operations by adding the following code snippets to the file (at the end of the `main` function) and re-executing the script. In some snippets, you need to replace the `__USER__ID__` placeholder with the ID of an actual user:

<QueryChooser titles={["Fetch single user", "Filter user list", "Update a user's name", "Delete user"]}>

```js lineNumbers,copy
const user = await prisma
  .user({ id: '__USER_ID__' })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
const usersCalledAlice = await prisma
  .users({
    where: {
      name: 'Alice'
    }
  })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
 const updatedUser = await prisma
  .updateUser({
    where: { id: '__USER_ID__' },
    data: { name: 'Bob' }
  })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
 const deletedUser = await prisma
  .deleteUser({ id: '__USER_ID__' })
```

</QueryChooser>
