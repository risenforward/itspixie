}

## Goals

On this page, you will learn how to:

- Install the Prisma CLI
- Start a local Prisma server using Docker
- Introspect your existing database and generate a service configuration
- Deploy a Prisma service to the local Prisma server
- Generate a Prisma Client for your service
- Read and write data using the Prisma Client

<Warning>

Using your existing database with Prisma currently only works when using **PostgreSQL** databases.

</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have connection details for your database at hand. This includes the following pieces of information:

- **Host**: The host of your Postgres server, e.g. `localhost`.
- **Port**: The port where your Postgres server listens, e.g. `5432`.
- **User & Password**: The credentials for your Postgres server.
- **Name of existing _database_**: The name of the Postgres _database_.
- **Name of existing _schema_**: The name of the Postgres _schema_, e.g. `public`.

You also need to know whether your database server uses **SSL**.

## Install the Prisma CLI

The [Prisma CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma) is used to deploy and manage Prisma services. You can install it using NPM:

```bash copy
npm install -g prisma
```

## Install Docker

To use Prisma locally, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker yet, you can download the Docker Community Edition for your operating system [here](https://www.docker.com/community-edition).

## Set up Prisma server

### Create Docker Compose file

To launch a Prisma server on your machine, you need a Docker Compose file that configures the Prisma server and specifies to which database it can connect:

```bash copy
touch docker-compose.yml
```

### Add Prisma Docker image

Paste the following contents into the Docker Compose file you just created:

```yml copy
version: '3'
services:
  prisma:
    image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.16
    restart: always
    ports:
    - "4466:4466"
    environment:
      PRISMA_CONFIG: |
        port: 4466
        databases:
          default:
            connector: postgres
            host: __YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST__
            port: __YOUR_POSTGRES_PORT__
            database: __YOUR_POSTGRES_DB__
            schema: __YOUR_POSTGRES_SCHEMA__
            user: __YOUR_POSTGRES_USER__
            password: __YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD__
            migrations: false
            ssl: __SSL_CONNECTION__
```

### Specify database connection

To specify the database to which your Prisma server should connect, replace the placeholders that are spelled all-uppercased in the Docker Compose files with the corresponding values of your database:

- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_HOST__`: The host of your Postgres server, e.g. `localhost`.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_PORT__`: The port where your Postgres server listens, e.g. `5432`.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_DB__`: The name of your Postgres database.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_SCHEMA__`: The name of your Postgres schema, e.g. `public`.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_USER__`: The database user.
- `__YOUR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD__`: The password for the database user.
- `__SSL_CONNECTION__`: Whether your database server uses SSL, possible values are `true` and `false`.

### Start Prisma server

To start the Prisma server and launch the connected database, run the following command:

```bash copy
docker-compose up -d
```

Your local Prisma Server is now running on `http://localhost:4466`.

## Introspect database schema

### Create prisma.yml

Before deploying the Prisma service, you need to create a `prisma.yml`:

```bash copy
touch prisma.yml
```

Now add the following contents to it:

```yml copy
endpoint: http://localhost:4466
```

> The `endpoint` needs to match the URL of a running Prisma Server.

### Run `prisma introspect`

You now need to introspect your database schema to generate the data model for your Prisma service:

```bash copy
prisma introspect
```

The CLI generates the `datamodel-[TIMESTAMP].graphql` (e.g. `datamodel-1533886167692.graphql`) file containing the SDL version of your database schema. It also writes the `datamodel` property into the `prisma.yml`.

Finally, you need to rename the file to `datamodel.graphql` because that's the file name you specifed in `prisma.yml`.

## Deploy the Prisma service

This service configuration now needs to be _deployed_ so you can use the Prisma API of your service:

```bash copy
prisma deploy
```

<Warning>

Launching the Prisma server may take a few minutes. In case the `prisma deploy` command fails, wait a few minutes and try again. Also run `docker ps` to ensure the Docker container is actually running.

</Warning>

## Generate your Prisma Client

The Prisma Client is a custom, auto-generated library that connects to the API of your Prisma Service. Append the following lines to the end of your `prisma.yml`:

```yml
generate:
  - generator: javascript
    output: generated
```


## Prepare Node application

Run the following command to create an empty Node script:

```bash copy
touch index.js
```

Next, initialize an empty NPM project in the current directory and add the `prisma-lib` dependency:

```bash copy
npm init -y
npm install prisma-lib --save
```

## Read and write data using the Prisma Client

<Warning>

The API operations of the Prisma Client depend on the data model that was generated from the database introspection. The following sample queries assume there is a `User` type in the data model defined as follows:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  name: String!
}
```

If you don't have such a `User` type, feel free to adjust the following code snippets with a type that matches your data model.

</Warning>

Now type the following code in `index.js` and save it afterwards:

```js copy
const { Prisma } = require('./prisma')

const prisma = new Prisma()

async function main() {

  // Create a new user called `Alice`
  const newUser = await prisma.createUser({ name: 'Alice' })
  console.log(`Created new user: ${newUser.name} (ID: ${newUser.id})`)

  // Read all users from the database and print them to the console
  const allUsers = await prisma.users()
  console.log(allUsers)
}

main()
```

Execute the script with the following command:

```bash copy
node index.js
```

Whenever you run this script with that command, a new user record is created in the database (because of the call to `prisma.createUser()`). 

Feel free to play around with the Prisma Client API and try out some of the following operations by adding the following code snippets to the file (at the end of the `main` function) and re-executing the script. In some snippets, you need to replace the `__USER__ID__` placeholder with the ID of an actual user:

<QueryChooser titles={["Fetch single user", "Filter user list", "Update a user's name", "Delete user"]}>

```js lineNumbers,copy
const user = await prisma
  .user({ id: '__USER_ID__' })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
const usersCalledAlice = await prisma
  .users({
    where: {
      name: 'Alice'
    }
  })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
 const updatedUser = await prisma
  .updateUser({
    where: { id: '__USER_ID__' },
    data: { name: 'Bob' }
  })
```

```js lineNumbers,copy
 const deletedUser = await prisma
  .deleteUser({ id: '__USER_ID__' })
```

</QueryChooser>









## Explore the Prisma API in a Playground

The Prisma API of your service exposes CRUD and realtime operations for the types defined in your data model. You can explore the API in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground) using the following command:

```bash copy
prisma playground
```

The queries and mutations you can send depend on the data model that was generated from the database introspection. The following sample queries assume there is a `User` type in the data model defined as follows:

```graphql
type User @pgTable(name: "User") {
  id: Int! @unique
  name: String!
}
```

Depending on what your data model looks like, you can derive equivalent queries and mutations for your case. You can also use the auto-generated API documentation in the Playground to learn about the available API operations.

<QueryChooser titles={["Create new user", "Query all users", "Update a user's name", "Delete user"]}>

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
mutation {
  createUser(data: {
    name: "Alice"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
query {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
mutation {
  updateUser(
    where: { id: __USER_ID__ },
    data: { name: "Sarah" }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

```graphql lineNumbers,copy
mutation {
  deleteUser(where: {
    id: __USER_ID__
  }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

</QueryChooser>
