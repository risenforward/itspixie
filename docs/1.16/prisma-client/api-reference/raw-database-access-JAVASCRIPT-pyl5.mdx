## Overview

The Prisma client lets you send raw database queries using the `$raw` property.

Since a Prisma server can be connected to multiple databases, you can select the database you want to access via dot notation, for example a database named `my-database` could be accessed like this: `$raw.my-database(SELECT * FROM user)`. For each Prisma server, there is one `default` database - for convenience, you can omit the dot notation for the `default` database: `$raw(SELECT * FROM user)`
