## Overview

[Schema delegation](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-schema-stitching-explained-schema-delegation-4c6caf468405/) is a concept from GraphQL. It means that a GraphQL server forwards ("delegates") an incoming request to another GraphQL server to be resolved there instead of resolving the request itself. It therefore passes the `info` object to the underlying GraphQL schema of the final GraphQL server. 

> Learn more about the `info` object in [this](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-demystifying-the-info-argument-in-graphql-resolvers-6f26249f613a/) article.

Schema delegation is only applicable in the context of a GraphQL resolver function where the `info` object is available. The Prisma Client exposes schema delegation functionality via the `$delegate` property. For each operation in your [Prisma GraphQL API](./prisma-graphql-api), the `$delegate` property exposes one function. The function needs to be prefixed with the _operation type_, i.e. `query`, `mutation` or `subscription`. For example, the delegate function for a `users` query and a `createUser` mutation need to be invoked as follows: `prisma.query.users(...)` and `prisma.mutation.createUser(...)`. 
Generally, the API of the `$delegate` property is similar to the one of a [GraphQL Binding](https://oss.prisma.io/content/graphql-binding/01-overview).

When one of the delegate functions is invoked, the Prisma Client constructs a corresponding GraphQL query and injects the selection set that was provided in the first GraphQL query into the newly constructed one.

### Examples

_Delegate a `users` query to the Prisma GraphQL API_:

Schema definition:

```graphql
# import User from "prisma.graphql"

type Query {
  users: [User!]!
}
```

Resolver implementation:

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users = (root, args, context, info) => {
      return prisma.$delegate.query.users(
        info,
      })
    }
  }
}
```

_Delegate a `createUser` mutation to the Prisma GraphQL API_:

Schema definition:

```graphql
# import User from "prisma.graphql"

type Mutation {
  createUser: User!
}
```

Resolver implementation:

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    users = (root, args, context, info: GraphQLResolveInfo) => {
      return prisma.$delegate.mutation.createUser(
        info,
      })
    }
  }
}
```
