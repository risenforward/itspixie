# Setting up Clusters with Prisma Cloud and Google Cloud SQL

This guide gets you up and running with [Prisma Cloud](https://www.prismagraphql.com/cloud/) and [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/).

> In Google Cloud you are able to receive 300$ credit for free for 12 months.

In the following sections, you are going to learn how to:

- Provision a MySQL database instance using Google Cloud SQL
- Set up a new Prisma cluster using the Prisma Cloud Console
- Use the MySQL database as a backing data store for your Prisma cluster

## 1 Signing up for Google Cloud

<Instruction>

If you don't have an Google account yet, [sign up here](https://cloud.google.com/).

</Instruction>

This process might take a little while, but you'll get there! Note that you'll have to provide credit card info as well as your phone number at some point during the process.

### 1.1 Creating a new Google Cloud SQL instance

In this section, you'll spin up a new Google Cloud SQL instance in the `us-east1` region. If you prefer, feel free to choose any of the other supported regions instead:

* `us-central1` / US Central (Iowa)
* `us-east1` / US East (South Carolina)
* `us-east4` / US East (Northern Virginia)
* `us-west1` / US West (Oregon)
* `southamerica-east1` / South America East (SÃ£o Paulo)
* `northamerica-northeast1` / Canada North-East (MontrÃ©al)
* `europe-west1` / Belgium (St. Ghislain)
* `europe-west2` / Belgium (St. Ghislain)
* `europe-west3` / Belgium (St. Ghislain)
* `europe-west4` / Belgium (St. Ghislain)
* `australia-southeast1` / Australia (Sydney)
* `asia-east1` / Asia Pacific (Changhua County, Taiwan)
* `asia-northeast1` / Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
* `asia-south1` / India (Mumbai)

### 1.2 Get started

<Instruction>

First you need to make a project.

To setup a new Google Cloud SQL instance in the `us-east1` region, go in the navigation on the left to Storage/SQL. And click the button **Create Instance**

</Instruction>

### 1.3 Select DB type

<Instruction>

In the **Select MySQL**, click **Next**. And you will be prompted between First and Second Generation. Click **Choose Second Generation**.

</Instruction>

### 1.4 Fill in the instance details

<Instruction>

For the the purpose of this you can use whatever you want.
For example:
- **Instance ID**: prisma
- **Root password**: graphcool12345
- **Region**: `us-east1`
- **Zone**: Any

And click **Create**

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Now your instance is being created.

</Instruction>

### 1.2 Configure access from an external IP-address

<Instruction>

Click the name of your instance, in this case `prisma`. And continue to the tab **Authorization**. Here a network needs to be added. Click **Add Network**. And put `0.0.0.0/0` in the Network input. Click **Done** to save the changes. Now Prisma Cloud should be able to reach your Google Cloud SQL instance using user `root` and the password you defined using the public ip of the instance.

The public ip can be found in the tab **Overview** of your instance located on **Connect to this instance**.

</Instruction>

## 2. Creating a Prisma cluster

> **Note**: Creating your own Prisma Cluster requires you to provide valid credit card information. Pricing starts at  **$45 / month** per cluster in a **pay-as-you-go** fashion. Find more info about the pricing [here](https://www.prismagraphql.com/cloud/pricing).

### 2.1 Signing into Prisma Cloud

<Instruction>

Navigate to the [Prisma Cloud Console](https://app.prisma.sh) and login or sign up.

</Instruction>

### 2.2 Cluster Vvew

<Instruction>

To create a new Prisma cluster that is connected to your newly created MySQL database, navigate to the **Clusters** view by selecting the corresponding tab in the top-menu.

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

To move on to the form where you can provide the details about your database to connect it with your cluster, click the **Create Clusters** button.

</Instruction>

### 2.3 Database and cluster information

> **Note**: To learn more about the required information to create a new cluster, you can check out this 3-min tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jELE4KXJPn4&lc).

<Instruction>

Insert the required data:

- **Host**: This is the _endpoint_ from the previous section **2.6 Instance settings**
- **Port**: If you haven't made any changes, the default port if **3306**
- **User**: The username you chose in section **2.4 Specify DB details** (e.g. `myusername`)
- **Password**: The password you chose in section **2.4 Specify DB details** (e.g. `prismagraphql`)

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

When you're done with that, select click **Test connection**.

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

After the connection was successfully tested, you need to provide a **Cluster name** (e.g. `my-cluster`) and optionally a **Description**.

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Finally, you need to select a **Cluster region** - choose the one that's closest to where the majority of your users is supposably located.

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

If you haven't done so before, you need now need to provide your credit card information. Finally, click **Create Cluster**.

</Instruction>

### 2.4 Provisioning a cluster

The process of setting up a cluster usually shouldn't take longer than a few seconds. The provisioning status of your cluster will be printed continuously.

You can navigate back to the cluster overview and follow the provisioning status. Once your cluster is up and running, the status says **Healthy**.

## 3. Deploying a Prisma service to the cluster

Now that you provisioned a cluster, you can use it as a runtime environment for your Prisma services by using it as a deployment target.

<Instruction>

Install the latest CLI version with the following command:

```sh
npm install -g prisma
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Then, log into your Prisma Cloud account:

```sh
prisma login
```

</Instruction>

This will store your _cloud session key_ in `~/.prisma/config.yml`. This key is used by the CLI to authenticate you against Prisma Cloud.

<Instruction>

Next, go ahead and create a new service:

```sh
prisma init hello-world
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

When prompted by the CLI, choose the `Minimal setup: database-only` option. Then navigate into the newly created directory and deploy the service:

```sh
cd hello-world
prisma deploy
```

</Instruction>

After running `prisma deploy`, the Prisma CLI will prompt you to choose a cluster you'd like to use as a deployment target. Among the options, you'll find the cluster that you've just setup.

<Instruction>

Select the cluster that you just created in the CLI.

</Instruction>

This is it - your Prisma service is now deployed to your own Prisma Cloud cluster ðŸš€
