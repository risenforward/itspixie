### How is this different from Graphcool?

The predecessor of Prisma was the Graphcool Framework, an open-source BaaS-like solution that provided an entire web server setup with a powerful GraphQL API.

Prisma is the result of many learnings and a lot of feedback from customers and the community and now enables you to take full control of your GraphQL server while still being able to benefit from an auto-generated and powerful GraphQL API.
