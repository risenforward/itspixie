# Migrations

<InfoBox type=info>

The way how **database migrations** are performed with Graphcool is not yet finalized. You can follow the discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/graphcool/framework/issues/1263). For now, migrations are done using the _temporary_ directives: `@rename` and `@migrationValue`.
