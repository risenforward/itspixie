# Overview

A Prisma service exposes a GraphQL API that is automatically generated based on the deployed _data model_. It is also referred to as the **Prisma API**.

## Exploring the Prisma API

The [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground) is the best tool to explore the Prisma API and get to know it better. You can use it to run GraphQL mutations, queries and subscriptions.

To open up a Playground for your database service, simply run the `prisma playground` command in the working directory of your service or paste your service's HTTP endpoint into the address bar of your browser.
