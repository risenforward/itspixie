# Mutation API

## Overview

A _GraphQL mutation_ is used to modify data. This is an example mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(
    title: "My great Vacation"
    slug: "my-great-vacation"
    published: true
    text: "Read about my great vacation."
  ) {
    id
    slug
  }
}
```

Here's a list of available mutations. To explore them, use the [playground](!alias-aiteerae6l#graphcool-playground) for your service.

* Based on the [model types](!alias-eiroozae8u#model-types) and [relations](!alias-eiroozae8u#relations) in your data model, [type mutations](#type-mutations) and [relation mutations](#relation-mutations) will be generated to modify nodes and edges.

## Type mutations

For every available [model type](!alias-eiroozae8u#model-types) in your data model, certain mutations are automatically generated.

For example, if your schema contains a `Post` type:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  title: String!
  description: String
}
```

the following type mutations will be available:

* the `createPost` mutation [creates a new node](#creating-a-node).
* the `updatePost` mutation [updates an existing node](#updating-a-node).
* the `deletePost` mutation [deletes an existing node](#deleting-a-node).

### Creating a node

Creates a new node for a specific type that gets assigned a new `id`.
All [required](!alias-eiroozae8u#required) fields of the type without a [default value](!alias-eiroozae8u#default-value) have to be specified, the other fields are optional arguments. All mutation arguments are wrapped in a single input object called `data`.

The query response can contain all fields of the newly created node, including the `id` field.

Create a new `Post` node and query its `id` and `slug`:

```graphql
mutation {
  createPost(data: {
    title: "My great Vacation"
    slug: "my-great-vacation"
    published: true
    text: "Read about my great vacation."
  }) {
    id
    slug
  }
}
```

### Updating a node

Updates [fields](!alias-eiroozae8u#fields) of an existing node of a certain [model type](!alias-eiroozae8u#model-types) specified by the `id` (or any other unique) field. The node's fields will be updated according to the additionally provided values which are wrapped in the `data` input object.

The query response can contain all fields of the updated node.

Update the `text` and `published` fields for an existing `Post` node and query its `id`:

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(data: {
    text: "This is the start of my biggest adventure!"
    published: true
  }, where: {
    id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n"  # or any other unique field
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

### Deleting a node

Deletes a node specified by the `id` (or any other unique) field.

The query response can contain all fields of the deleted node.

Delete an existing `Post` node and query its (then deleted) `id` and `title`:

```graphql
mutation {
  deletePost(where: {
    id: "cixneo7zp3cda0134h7t4klep"  # or any other unique field
  }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

## Relation mutations

To update the relations between nodes, you need to use the `update`-mutation for the corresponding type.

The following data model will be used for all examples in this section:

```graphql
type User {
  id: ID! @unique
  username: String! @unique
  name: String
  posts: [Post!]!
}

type Post {
  id: ID! @unique
  title: String!
  author: User
}
```

In order to apply a relation mutation on the `author` field of `Post`, you need to use the following base syntax (note the mutation is not complete):

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(
    where: {
      id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n" # or any other unique field
    }
    data: {
      author: {
        <operation>: <data>
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

The above mutation has two placeholders that need to be properly set in an actual mutation:

- `<operation>`: This specifies the _kind_ of relation mutation and can be either of the following: `create`, `update`, `delete`, `upsert`, `connect`, `disconnect`
- `<data>`: The input data for the corresponding operation

See the following examples to see different scenarios in practice.

### "To-one"-relations

#### Connect two nodes in a "to-one"-relation

Creates a new edge between two nodes specified by their `id` (or any other unique field).

Connecting a `Post` with a `User` node can be done as follows:

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(
    where: {
      id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n" # or any other unique field
    }
    data: {
      author: {
        connect: {
          username: "alice" # or any other unique field
        }
      }
    }
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Create a new node for a "to-one"-relation

Creates a new node and connects it with an existing node specified by its `id` (or any other unique field).

Connecting an existing `Post` node with a newly created `User` node can be done as follows:

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(
    where: {
      id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n" # or any other unique field
    }
    data: {
      author: {
        create: {
          username: "johnny"
          name: "Johne Doe"
        }
      }
    }
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Update a node in a "to-one"-relation

Updates a related node by its `id` (or any other unique field).

Updating the `name` of an existing `User` node by a related `Post` node where it's the `author`:

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(
    where: {
      id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n" # or any other unique field
    }
    data: {
      author: {
        update: {
          name: "John Doe-Doe"
        }
      }
    }
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Update or create a node in a "to-one"-relation

Updates or creates a related node by its `id` (or any other unique field).

Updating the `name` of an existing `User` node by a related `Post` node where it's the `author` if it already exists, otherwise create it:

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(
    where: {
      id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n" # or any other unique field
    }
    data: {
      author: {
        upsert: {
          create: {
            name: "John Doe-Doe"
          }
          update: {
            name: "John Doe-Doe"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Delete a node in a "to-one"-relation

Updates a related node by its `id` (or any other unique field).

Deletes the `User` node by a related `Post` node where it's the `author`:

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(
    where: {
      id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n" # or any other unique field
    }

      author: {
        delete: true
      }
    }
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Disconnect two nodes in a "to-one"-relation

Removes an edge between two nodes speficied by their `id` (or any other unique field).

Disconnecting a `Post` from a `User` node can be done as follows:

```graphql
mutation {
  updatePost(
    where: {
      id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n" # or any other unique field
    }
    data: {

    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

### "To-many"-relations

#### Connect nodes to a "to-many"-relation

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    where: {
      id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n" # or any other unique field
    }

```

#### Update or create nodes in a "to-many"-relation

Updates existing nodes by a related node specified by its `id` (or any other unique field) or creates them if they didn't exist before.

Update the titles of two existing `Post` nodes by a related `User` node or create them if they didn't exist before:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    where: {
      id: "cixnen24p33lo0143bexvr52n" # or any other unique field

            create: { title: "I love GraphQL very much" }
            update: { title: "I love GraphQL very much" }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Delete nodes in a "to-many"-relation

Deletes existing nodes by a related node specified by its `id` (or any other unique field).

Delete two existing `Post` nodes by a related `User` node:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    where: {

    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

#### Disconnect nodes in a "to-many"-relation

Removes one edge between two nodes specified by `id` (or any other unique field).

The query response can contain both nodes of the former edge. The names of query arguments and node names depend on the field names of the relation.
