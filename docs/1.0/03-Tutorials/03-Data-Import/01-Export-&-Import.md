# Deploy a GraphQL server with Now

Once you're done implementing your GraphQL server and have tested it enough locally to make it available to the general public, you need to _deploy_ it to the web.

In this tutorial, you're going to learn how you can use [Now](https://zeit.co/now) - an amazing one-click deployment tool from the [Zeit](https://zeit.co/) team - to deploy your GraphQL server.

## Install Now Desktop

The first thing you to do is download the Now Desktop and login.

<Instruction>

Open [`https://zeit.co/download`](https://zeit.co/download) in your browser and hit the **DOWNLOAD**-button.

</Instruction>

> **Note**: Now Desktop includes the `now` CLI.

## Bootstrap a GraphQL server

In this tutorial, you'll use the [`node-basic`](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/node-graphql-server/tree/master/basic) GraphQL boilerplate project as a sample server to be deployed. The easiest way to get access to this boilerplate is by using the `graphql create` command from the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli/).

The boilerplate project is based on [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga/), a lightweight GraphQL server based on Express.js, `apollo-server` and `graphql-tools`.

<Instruction>

If you haven't already, go ahead and install the GraphQL CLI. Then, bootstrap your GraphQL server with `graphql create`:

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli
graphql create hello-world -b node-basic
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

When being prompted where (i.e. to which _cluster_) to deploy your Prisma service, choose one of the _public cluster_ options: `graphcool-eu1` or `graphcool-us1`.

</Instruction>

The above `graphql create` command creates a new directory called `hello-world` where it places the source files for your GraphQL server as well as the configuration for the belonging Prisma service.

## Deploy the server with `now`

You now have the right foundation to deploy your GraphQL server.

<Instruction>

All you need to is navigate into the `hello-world` directory and invoke `now`:

```sh
cd hello-world
now
```

</Instruction>

> **Note**: If this is the first time you're using `now`, it will ask you to authenticate with their service.

That's it, your GraphQL server is now deployed and available under the URL printed by the CLI ðŸŽ‰  The URL looks similar to `https://hello-world-__ID__.now.sh` (where `__ID__` is a random ID for your service generated by `now`).
