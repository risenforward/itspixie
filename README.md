**Graphcool is a GraphQL backend development framework.** Think about it like Rails or Meteor but based on GraphQL and designed for today's (serverless) infrastructure.

* GraphQL abstraction over your database
* Enables scalable, event-driven architectures
* Compatible with existing tools (GraphQL.js, Apollo, Serverless)

## Contents

## Quickstart

[Watch this 2 min tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg_SJ8a5xpA) or follow the steps below to get started with the Graphcool framework:

1. **Install the CLI via NPM:**

  ```sh
  npm install -g graphcool@next
  ```

2. **Init new project:**

  ```sh
  graphcool init
  ```

3. **Configure data model & project:**

  Edit `types.graphql` to define your data model and setup functions & permissions in  `graphcool.yml`.

  The `graphcool.yml` file is the core of your application and should look like this:

  ```yml
  # Define your data model here
  types: types.graphql

  # Configure the permissions for your data model
  permissions:
  - operation: "*"

  # tokens granting root level access to your API
  rootTokens: []

  # You can implement your business logic using functions
  functions:
    hello:
      handler:
        code: src/hello.js
      type: resolver
      schema: src/hello.graphql
  ```

4. **Deploy your changes:**

  You can deploy your changes and migrate your database by running the following command:

  ```sh
  graphcool deploy
  ```

5. **Connect to your GraphQL endpoint:**

  Use the endpoint from step (2) in your frontend (or backend) applications to connect to your GraphQL API.
