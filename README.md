**Graphcool is a GraphQL backend framework** to develop and deploy production-ready GraphQL microservices.</br>
Think about it like Rails, Django or Meteor but based on [GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/) and designed for today's cloud infrastructure.

The framework currently supports Node.js & Typescript and is compatible with existing libraries and tools like [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) and [Apollo Server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server). Graphcool comes with a CLI and a Docker-based runtime which can be deployed to any server or cloud.

The framework provides powerful abstractions and building blocks to develop flexible, scalable GraphQL backends:

1. **GraphQL-native database mapping** to easily evolve your data schema & migrate your database
2. **Flexible auth workflows** using the JWT-based authentication & permission system
3. **Real-time API** using GraphQL Subscriptions
4. **Highly scalable architecture** enabling asynchronous, event-driven flows using serverless functions
5. **Works with all frontend frameworks** like React, Vue.js, Angular

## Quickstart

> **Note:** This is a preview version of the Graphcool Framework (latest `0.7`). More information in the [forum](https://www.graph.cool/forum/t/feedback-new-cli-beta/949).

[Watch this 2 min tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg_SJ8a5xpA) or follow the steps below to get started with the Graphcool framework:

1. **Install the CLI via NPM:**

  ```sh
  npm install -g graphcool@next
  ```

2. **Create a new service:**

  The following command creates all files you need for a new [service](https://docs-next.graph.cool/reference/service-definition/overview-opheidaix3).

  ```sh
  graphcool init
  ```

3. **Define your data model:**

  Edit `types.graphql` to define your data model using the [GraphQL SDL notation](https://docs-next.graph.cool/reference/database/data-modelling-eiroozae8u). `@model` types map to the database.
  
  ```graphql
  type User @model {
    id: ID! @isUnique
    name: String!
    dateOfBirth: DateTime
  
    # You can declare relations between models like this
    posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "UserPosts")
  }
  
  
  type Post @model {
    id: ID! @isUnique
    title: String!
  
    # Every relation also required a back-relation (to determine 1:1, 1:n or n:m)
    author: User! @relation(name: "UserPosts")
  }

  ```

4. **Define permissions and functions:**

  `graphcool.yml` is the root definition of a service where `types`, `permissions` and `functions` are referenced.

  ```yml
  # Define your data model here
  types: types.graphql

  # Configure the permissions for your data model
  permissions:
  - operation: "*"

  # tokens granting root level access to your API
  rootTokens: []

  # You can implement your business logic using functions
  functions:
    hello:
      handler:
        code: src/hello.js
      type: resolver
      schema: src/hello.graphql
  ```
  
5. **Implement API Gateway layer (optional):**

6. **Deploy your service:**

  To deploy your service simply run the following command and select either a hosted BaaS cluster or automatically setup a local Docker-based development environment:

  ```sh
  graphcool deploy
  ```

7. **Connect to your GraphQL endpoint:**

  Use the endpoint from the previous step in your frontend (or backend) applications to connect to your GraphQL API.

## Philosophy

## FAQ

### Wait a minute â€“ isn't Graphcool a Backend-as-a-Service?

While Graphcool started out as a Backend-as-a-Service (like Firebase or Parse), [we're currently in the process](https://blog.graph.cool/graphcool-framework-preview-ff42081b1333) of turning Graphcool into a backend development framework. No worries, you can still deploy your Graphcool services to the BaaS platform as before but additionally you can now also run Graphcool on your own machine.

### Why is Graphcool Core written in Scala?

### Is the API Gateway layer needed?
