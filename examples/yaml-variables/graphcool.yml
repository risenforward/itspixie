# The service name is composed of the environment variable
# `SERVICE_NAME` and the `--stage` command line option.
# If `SERVICE_NAME` is not set, the default is `yaml-demo`.
# If `--stage` is not explicitly provided, it will use the 
# default value `dev`.
# Thus, the default service name is `yaml-demo-dev`.
service: ${env:SERVICE_NAME, 'yaml-demo'}-${opt:stage, 'dev'}

# You can also reference custom variables defined in this file.
# As `custom.modelPath` is set to `datamodel`, the file path
# for the data model will resolve to `mymodel.graphql`.
