# Hooks

This example demonstrates `hooks` property available to us in `prisma.yml`. The `hooks` property is used to define terminal commands which will be executed by the Prisma CLI before or after certain commands.

Currently, only `post-deploy` hook is available.

Using `hooks`, we can perform various workflows like:

1. Generation of schema file for the autogenerated Prisma GraphQL API.
2. Syncing the generated schema file with a service or client to implement persisted queries.

## Get started

### 1. Install the Prisma CLI
The `prisma` cli is the core component of your development workflow. `prisma` should be installed as a global dependency, you can install this with `npm install -g prisma`

### 2. Download the example & install dependencies

Clone the Prisma monorepo and navigate to this directory or download _only_ this example with the following command:

```sh
curl https://codeload.github.com/prismagraphql/prisma/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 prisma-master/examples/yml-structure
```

Next, navigate into the downloaded folder and install the NPM dependencies:

```sh
cd hooks
yarn install
```

### 3. Deploy the Prisma database service

You can now [deploy](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/cli-command-reference/database-service/prisma-deploy-kee1iedaov) the Prisma service (note that this requires you to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine - if that's not the case, follow the collapsed instructions below the code block):

```sh
# Ensure docker is running the server's dependencies
docker-compose up
# Deploy the server
cd prisma
prisma deploy
```

 <summary><strong>I don't have <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> installed on my machine</strong></summary>

To deploy your service to a demo server (rather than locally with Docker), please follow [this link](https://www.prisma.io/docs/quickstart/).

### 4. `hooks` property of `prisma.yml`

The `hooks` property is used to define terminal commands which will be executed by the Prisma CLI before or after certain commands.

Currently, only `post-deploy` hook is available. In this example, we are using the `post-deploy` hook to perform the following tasks

```yml
hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - echo "Deployment finished"
    - graphql get-schema --project db
    - graphql codegen
```

* Printing "Deployment finished"

* Getting the latest schema

* Running `graphql codegen` to generate TS bindings

Note that to run `graphql codegen` we need to have `prisma-binding` with version 2.0 or greater.

Note that these commands work closely in conjunction with `.graphqlconfig.yml` file that looks like this and directs the output of generate schema and typescript bindings.

```yml
projects:
  db:
    schemaPath: src/generated/prisma.graphql
    extensions:
      endpoints:
        default: 'http://localhost:4466/hooks'
      prisma: prisma.yml
      codegen:
        input:
          schema: src/generated/prisma.graphql
        output:
          typings: generated-prisma.ts
        generator: typegen
        language: typescript
```
