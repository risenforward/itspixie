// - Revision is an atomic sequence?
// - Always increment... but how? -> schedule actually saves the migration instead the top level thread
//   - This ensures that the single actor can serialize db access and check revision increment.
//
//- Each project has an own worker (Actor)
//-
//- Hm, we want to make sure that everything is received and in order
//- Protocol issue? ACK required?
//- Actors can make a failsafe query to ensure that the migration they get
//- ^ OR it just loads all projects and initializes deployment workers for each, the actors themselves can query the db and work off unapplied migrations
//- High spike in DB load, lots of IO on the actors, possibly overwhelming the db for smaller instances? But then again there shouldnâ€™t be that many projects on a small instance
//
//
//- schedule on the Migrator signals the respective worker -> pubsub on projectID
//- Causes the worker to scan and send a message to self
//- Might also be a forwarding actor that does that (query + forward)
//-
//
//- LastRevisionSeen as a safety net, no need to query really, just during init


// Q: Are messages that are not matched discarded? How to store these? Look at the pattern

  // Enhancement(s): In the shared cluster we might face issues with too many project actors / high overhead during bootup
