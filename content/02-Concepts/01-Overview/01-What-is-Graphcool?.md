# What is Graphcool

Graphcool is a modern backend development platform based on GraphQL and serverless techologies. It consists of multiple architectural components, like a GraphQL engine, an event gateway as well as an (optional) API proxy layer. Depending on your use case, you can choose to pick the parts that help you build your own backend easily or go with a full-blown hosted solution.
