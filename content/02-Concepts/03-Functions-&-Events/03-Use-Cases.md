# Use Cases

## Overview

When working with an API, you often have specific requirements for what the data that's stored in the database should look like. For example, you only want to allow your users to store valid email addresses. Or you want all phone numbers to be stored in the same format.

Graphcool offers two hook points where synchronous serverless functions can be invoked.
