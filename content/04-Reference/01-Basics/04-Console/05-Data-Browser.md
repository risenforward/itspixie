# Data Browser

In the **Data Browser** you can get an overview of the data for the different [types](!alias-ij2choozae) and [relations](!alias-goh5uthoc1) in your schema. Here you have the chance to create new data, or update or delete existing data.

New nodes for [system types](!alias-uhieg2shio) can't be created in the Data View.

> You can upload files to your project by drag-and-dropping them on the Data Browser.
