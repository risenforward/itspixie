# Console

The [Graphcool Console](http://console.graph.cool) provides a wide range of possibilities to manage your GraphQL projects. Apart from [different project settings](!alias-aechi6iequ), many powerful features are available:

* The [Schema Editor](!alias-zezoo7uaph) gives you an overview of your GraphQL schema and allows you to do [schema migrations](!alias-paesahku9t) either visually or on a textual basis.

* In the [Data Browser](!alias-och3ookaeb) you can view the stored data for the different [types](!alias-ij2choozae) in your GraphQL backend and modify or create new data*

* In the [Permission View](!alias-ou3ucheewu) you can view and modify [permissions](!alias-iegoo0heez) for operations based on [types](!alias-ij2choozae) and [relations](!alias-goh5uthoc1) in your schema

* The Integrations View allows you to enable or disable the available [integrations](!alias-seimeish6e) and configure their credentials.

* The [Functions View](!alias-ejamaid4ae) gives an overview over existing [functions](!alias-boo6uteemo), including most recent invocations and a detailed execution log

* In the [Playground](!alias-oe1ier4iej), you can explore and execute all GraphQL queries, mutations and subscriptions available in your [GraphQL API](!alias-heshoov3ai).
