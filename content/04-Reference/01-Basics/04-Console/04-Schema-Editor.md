# Schema Editor

The **Schema Editor** allows you to work with your project's [data schema](!alias-ahwoh2fohj) and evolve it using [schema migrations](!alias-paesahku9t). You can either use the left side to change your schema on a textual basis or use the right side to change your schema with the UI.

An integration with [graphql-voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager/) is available with the Graph View button. You can use it to explore your schema visually.

> More information about elements in the schema file can be found in the [schema](!alias-ahwoh2fohj) chapter while changes to the schema are described in the [schema migrations](!alias-paesahku9t) chapter.
