# File Management

As part of our file management system you are able to

* [upload files](!alias-xai9quoo0i) that are up to 200 MB as shown in [the examples](!alias-zaif4eing1)
* [download files](!alias-beim3teevi)
* [download and transform image files](!alias-atiede8ata)

Each project contains a [file type](!alias-uhieg2shio#file-type) by default that provides the possibility to add and modify files.

## File Management with the Client APIs

Currently, files cannot be uploaded from the [Simple API](!alias-heshoov3ai) or the [Relay API](!alias-aizoong9ah). Read [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo/issues/65) for more information.
