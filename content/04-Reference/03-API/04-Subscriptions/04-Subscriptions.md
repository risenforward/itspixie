# Subscriptions

*GraphQL subscriptions* allow you to be notified in realtime of changes to your data. This is an example subscription that notifies you whenever a new post is created:

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/cj03vcl4777hv0180zqjk5a6q
disabled: true
---
subscription newPosts {
  Post(
    filter: {
      mutation_in: [CREATED]
    }
  ) {
    mutation
    node {
      description
      imageUrl
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "Post": {
      "mutation": "CREATED",
      "node": {
        "description": "#bridge",
        "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1420768255295-e871cbf6eb81"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Subscriptions use [a special websocket endpoint](!alias-yahph3foch#project-endpoints).

Here's a list of available subscriptions. To explore them, use the [playground](!alias-oe1ier4iej) inside your project.

* For every [type](!alias-ij2choozae) in your [GraphQL schema](!alias-ahwoh2fohj), a [type subscription query](!alias-ohc0oorahn) is available to listen for changes to nodes of this.
* Currently, connecting or disconnecting nodes in a [relation](!alias-goh5uthoc1) does not trigger any subscription yet. Read more about [available workaround](!alias-riegh2oogh) for this limitation.

You can [combine multiple subscription triggers](!alias-kengor9ei3) into one subscription query to control exactly what events you want to be notified of.



## Subscription Requests

When using Apollo Client, you can use `subscription-transport-ws` to combine it with a WebSocket client. [Here's an example](https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-graphql/tree/master/subscriptions-with-apollo-instagram).

You can also use the GraphQL Playground or any WebSocket client as described below.

### Playground

The [Graphcool Playground](!alias-oe1ier4iej) can be used to explore and run GraphQL subscriptions.

Before diving into a specific implementation, **it's often better to get familiar with the available operations in the playground first**.

### Plain WebSockets

#### Establish connection

Subscriptions are managed through WebSockets. First establish a WebSocket connection and specify the `graphql-subscriptions` protocol:

```javascript
let webSocket = new WebSocket('wss://subscriptions.graph.cool/v1/__PROJECT_ID__', 'graphql-subscriptions');
```
#### Initiate Handshake

Next you need to initiate a handshake with the WebSocket server. You do this by listening to the `open` event and then sending a JSON message to the server with the `type` property set to `init`:

```javascript
webSocket.onopen = (event) => {
  const message = {
      type: 'init'
  }

  webSocket.send(JSON.stringify(message))
}
```

#### React to Messages

The server may respond with a variety of messages distinguished by their `type` property. You can react to each message as appropriate for your application:

```javascript
webSocket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data)

  switch (data.type) {
    case 'init_success': {
      console.log('init_success, the handshake is complete')
      break
    }
    case 'init_fail': {
      throw {
        message: 'init_fail returned from WebSocket server',
        data
      }
    }
    case 'subscription_data': {
      console.log('subscription data has been received', data)
      break
    }
    case 'subscription_success': {
      console.log('subscription_success')
      break
    }
    case 'subscription_fail': {
      throw {
        message: 'subscription_fail returned from WebSocket server',
        data
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Subscribe to Data Changes

To subscribe to data changes, send a message with the `type` property set to `subscription_start`:

```javascript
const message = {
  id: '1',
  type: 'subscription_start',
  query: `
    subscription newPosts {
      Post(filter: {
        mutation_in: [CREATED]
      }) {
        mutation
        node {
          description
          imageUrl
        }
      }
    }
  `
}

webSocket.send(JSON.stringify(message))
```

You should receive a message with `type` set to `subscription_success`. When data changes occur, you will receive messages with `type` set to `subscription_data`. The `id` property that you supply in the `subscription_start` message will appear on all `subscription_data` messages, allowing you to multiplex your WebSocket connection.

#### Unsubscribe from Data Changes

To unsubscribe from data changes, send a message with the `type` property set to `subscription_end`:

```javascript
const message = {
  id: '1',
  type: 'subscription_end'
}

webSocket.send(JSON.stringify(message))
```



## Type Subscriptions 

For every available [type](!alias-ij2choozae) mutation in your [GraphQL schema](!alias-ahwoh2fohj), certain subscriptions are automatically generated.

For example, if your schema contains a `Post` type:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
}
```

a `Post` subscription is available that you can use to be notified whenever certain nodes are [created](!alias-oe8oqu8eis), [updated](!alias-ohmeta3pi4) or [deleted](!alias-bag3ouh2ii).



### Subscribing to Created Nodes

For a given type, you can subscribe to all successfully created nodes using the generated type subscription.

#### Subscribe to all Created Nodes

If you want to subscribe to created nodes of the `Post` type, you can use the `Post` subscription and specify the `filter` object and set `mutation_in: [CREATED]`.

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/cj03vcl4777hv0180zqjk5a6q
disabled: true
---
subscription createPost {
  Post(
    filter: {
      mutation_in: [CREATED]
    }
  ) {
    mutation
    node {
      description
      imageUrl
      author {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "Post": {
      "mutation": "CREATED",
      "node": {
        "description": "#bridge",
        "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1420768255295-e871cbf6eb81",
        "author": {
          "id": "cj03wz212nbvt01925reuolju"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The payload contains

* `mutation`: in this case it will return `CREATED`
* `node`: allows you to query information on the created node and connected nodes

#### Subscribe to Specific Created Nodes

You can make use of a similar [filter system as for queries](!alias-xookaexai0) using the `node` argument of the `filter` object.

For example, to only be notified of a created post if a specific user follows the author:

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/cj03vcl4777hv0180zqjk5a6q
disabled: true
---
subscription followedAuthorCreatedPost {
  Post(
    filter: {
      mutation_in: [CREATED]
      node: {
        author: {
          followedBy_some: {
            id: "cj03x3nacox6m0119755kmcm3"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    mutation
    node {
      description
      imageUrl
      author {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "Post": {
      "mutation": "CREATED",
      "node": {
        "description": "#bridge",
        "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1420768255295-e871cbf6eb81",
        "author": {
          "id": "cj03wz212nbvt01925reuolju"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```



### Subscribing to Deleted Nodes

For a given type, you can subscribe to all successfully deleted nodes using the generated type subscription.

#### Subscribe to all Deleted Nodes

If you want to subscribe for updated nodes of the `Post` type, you can use the `Post` subscription and specify the `filter` object and set `mutation_in: [DELETED]`.

```graphql
subscription deletePost {
  Post(
    filter: {
      mutation_in: [DELETED]
    }
  ) {
    mutation
    previousValues {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

The payload contains

* `mutation`: in this case it will return `DELETED`
* `previousValues`: previous scalar values of the node

> Note: `previousValues` is `null` for `CREATED` subscriptions.

#### Subscribe to Specific Deleted Nodes

You can make use of a similar [filter system as for queries](!alias-xookaexai0) using the `node` argument of the `filter` object.

For example, to only be notified of a deleted post if a specific user follows the author:

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/cj03vcl4777hv0180zqjk5a6q
disabled: true
---
subscription followedAuthorUpdatedPost {
  Post(
    filter: {
      mutation_in: [DELETED]
      node: {
        author: {
          followedBy_some: {
            id: "cj03x3nacox6m0119755kmcm3"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    mutation
    previousValues {
      id
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "Post": {
      "mutation": "DELETED",
      "previousValues": {
        "id": "cj03x8r0mqhdq01190hx2ad2b"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Subscribing to Updated Nodes

For a given type, you can subscribe to all successfully updated nodes using the generated type subscription.

#### Subscribe to all Updated Nodes

If you want to subscribe for updated nodes of the `Post` type, you can use the `Post` subscription and specify the `filter` object and set `mutation_in: [UPDATED]`.

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/cj03vcl4777hv0180zqjk5a6q
disabled: true
---
subscription updatePost {
  Post(
    filter: {
      mutation_in: [UPDATED]
    }
  ) {
    mutation
    node {
      description
      imageUrl
      author {
        id
      }
    }
    updatedFields
    previousValues {
      description
      imageUrl
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "Post": {
      "mutation": "UPDATED",
      "node": {
        "description": "#food",
        "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1432139438709-ee8369449944",
        "author": {
          "id": "cj03wz212nbvt01925reuolju"
        }
      }
      "updatedFields": [
        "imageUrl"
      ],
      "previousValues": {
        "description": "#food",
        "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1457518919282-b199744eefd6"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The payload contains

* `mutation`: in this case it will return `UPDATED`
* `node`: allows you to query information on the updated node and connected nodes
* `updatedFields`: a list of the fields that changed
* `previousValues`: previous scalar values of the node

> Note: `updatedFields` is `null` for `CREATED` and `DELETED` subscriptions. `previousValues` is `null` for `CREATED` subscriptions.

#### Subscribe to Updated Fields

You can make use of a similar [filter system as for queries](!alias-xookaexai0) using the `node` argument of the `filter` object.

For example, to only be notified of an updated post if its `description` changed:

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/cj03vcl4777hv0180zqjk5a6q
disabled: true
---
subscription followedAuthorUpdatedPost {
  Post(
    filter: {
      mutation_in: [UPDATED]
      updatedFields_contains: "description"
    }
  ) {
    mutation
    node {
      description
    }
    updatedFields
    previousValues {
      description
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "Post": {
      "mutation": "UPDATED",
      "node": {
        "description": "#best #food",
        "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1457518919282-b199744eefd6",
        "author": {
          "id": "cj03wz212nbvt01925reuolju"
        }
      }
      "node": {
        "description": "#best #food"
      },
      "updatedFields": [
        "description"
      ],
      "previousValues": {
        "description": "#food"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Similarily to `updatedFields_contains`, more filter conditions exist:

* `updatedFields_contains_every: [String!]`: matches if all fields specified have been updated
* `updatedFields_contains_some: [String!]`: matches if some of the specified fields have been updated

> Note: you cannot use the `updatedFields` filter conditions together with `mutation_in: [CREATED]` or `mutation_in: [DELETED]`!




## Relation Subscriptions

Currently, subscriptions for relation updates are only available with a workaround using [update subscriptions](!alias-ohmeta3pi4).

### Subscribing to relation changes

You can force a notification changes by _touching_ nodes. Add a `dummy: String` field to the type in question and update this field for the node whose relation status just changed.

```graphql
mutation updatePost {
  updatePost(
    id: "some-id"
    dummy: "dummy" # do a dummy change to trigger update subscription
  )
}
```

If you're interested in a direct relation trigger for subscriptions, [please join the discussion at GitHub](https://github.com/graphcool/feature-requests/issues/146).


## Combining Subscriptions

You can subscribe to multiple mutations on the same type in one subscription.

### Subscribe to all Changes to all Nodes

Using the `mutation_in` argument of the `filter` object, you can select the type of mutation that you want to subscribe on. For example, to subscribe to the `createPost`, `updatePost` and `deletePost` mutations:

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/cj03vcl4777hv0180zqjk5a6q
disabled: true
---
subscription changedPost {
  Post(
    filter: {
      mutation_in: [CREATED, UPDATED, DELETED]
    }
  ) {
    mutation
    node {
      id
      description
    }
    updatedFields
    previousValues {
      description
      imageUrl
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "Post": {
      "mutation": "CREATED",
      "node": {
        "id": "cj03x8r0mqhdq01190hx2ad2b",
        "description": "#bridge"
      },
      "updatedFields": null,
      "previousValues": null
    }
  }
}
```

### Subscribe to all Changes to specific Nodes

To select specific nodes that you want to be notified about, use the `node` argument of the `filter` object. You can combine it with `mutation_in`. For example, to only be notified of created, updated and deleted posts if a specific user follows the author:

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/cj03vcl4777hv0180zqjk5a6q
disabled: true
---
subscription changedPost {
  Post(
    filter: {
      mutation_in: [CREATED, UPDATED, DELETED]
      node: {
        author: {
          followedBy_some: {
            id: "cj03x3nacox6m0119755kmcm3"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ) {
    mutation
    node {
      id
      description
    }
    updatedFields
    previousValues {
      description
      imageUrl
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "Post": {
      "mutation": "CREATED",
      "node": {
        "id": "cj03x8r0mqhdq01190hx2ad2b",
        "description": "#bridge"
      },
      "updatedFields": null,
      "previousValues": null
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: `previousValues` is `null` for `CREATED` subscriptions and `updatedFields` is `null` for `CREATED` and `DELETED` subscriptions.

### Advanced Subscription Filters

You can make use of a similar [filter system as for queries](!alias-xookaexai0) using the `filter` argument.

For example, you can subscribe to all `CREATED` and `DELETE` subscriptions, as well as all `UPDATED` subscriptions when the `imageUrl` was updated

```graphql
---
endpoint: https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/cj03vcl4777hv0180zqjk5a6q
disabled: true
---
subscription changedPost {
  Post(
    filter: {
      OR: [{
        mutation_in: [CREATED, DELETED]
      }, {
        mutation_in: [UPDATED]
        updatedFields_contains: "imageUrl"
      }]
    }
  ) {
    mutation
    node {
      id
      description
    }
    updatedFields
    previousValues {
      description
      imageUrl
    }
  }
}
---
{
  "data": {
    "Post": {
      "mutation": "CREATED",
      "node": {
        "id": "cj03x8r0mqhdq01190hx2ad2b",
        "description": "#bridge"
      },
      "updatedFields": null,
      "previousValues": null
    }
  }
}
```

> Note: Using any of the `updatedFields` filter conditions together with `CREATED` or `DELETED` subscriptions results in an error.

> Note: `previousValues` is `null` for `CREATED` subscriptions and `updatedFields` is `null` for `CREATED` and `DELETED` subscriptions.
