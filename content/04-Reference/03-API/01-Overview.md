description: An overview of the API capabilities in Graphcool.

# Overview

The basic idea of Graphcool, and in particular its _GraphQL engine_, is to provide an automatically generated CRUD API based on a data model that you specify for your project. Next to the CRUD API, Graphcool also generates a [Subscription API]() for realtime functionality.

This API further contains capabilities for filtering, ordering and pagination.

Notice that every Graphcool project by default comes with two different APIs:

- **Simple API**: Intuitive CRUD operations and data modelling
- **Relay API**: Adheres to the schema requirements of Relay
