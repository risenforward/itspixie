# Migrations

Schema migrations covers all changes you can make to your [data schema](!alias-ahwoh2fohj). This includes adding or modifying [types](!alias-ij2choozae), [fields](!alias-teizeit5se) and [relations](!alias-goh5uthoc1). Changes to your schema will be reflected in both the [Schema Editor in the Console](!alias-zezoo7uaph) as well as the [project file](!alias-uhieg2shio) and affect the operations in your [API](!alias-heshoov3ai).

You can either use the [Console](!alias-uh8shohxie) or the [CLI](!alias-kie1quohli) to execute schema migrations, but we'll use the GraphQL schema to describe possible schema migrations in the following sections.

## Schema Migrations in the Console

The [Console](!alias-uh8shohxie) provides two ways to update the schema. You can either use the **schema editor** to quickly iterate with schema changes. Or you create or modify the different elements using the UI.

## Schema Migrations with the CLI

The [CLI](!alias-kie1quohli) leverages the [project file](!alias-uhieg2shio) and allows you to synchronize schema changes across your local environment and the Console.
