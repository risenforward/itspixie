**The Graphcool backend development framework** is designed to help you develop and deploy production-ready GraphQL microservices. With Graphcool you can design your data model and have a production ready [GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/) API online in minutes.

The framework integrates with cloud-native serverless functions and is compatible with existing libraries and tools like [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) and [Apollo Server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server). Graphcool comes with a CLI and a Docker-based runtime which can be deployed to any server or cloud.

<!-- 
Add note that Graphcool can still be used with other langs via webhooks??
-->

The framework provides powerful abstractions and building blocks to develop flexible, scalable GraphQL backends:
    
1. **GraphQL database** to easily evolve your data schema & migrate your database
2. **Flexible auth** using the JWT-based authentication & permission system
3. **Realtime API** using GraphQL Subscriptions
4. **Highly scalable architecture** enabling asynchronous, event-driven flows using serverless functions
5. **Works with all frontend frameworks** like React, Vue.js, Angular ([Quickstart Examples](https://graph.cool/docs/quickstart/))
