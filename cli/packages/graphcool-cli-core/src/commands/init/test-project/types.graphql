# This file contains the GraphQL Types
# Graphcool has one special type, the File type:

# type File implements Node {
#   contentType: String!
#   createdAt: DateTime!
#   id: ID! @isUnique
#   name: String!
#   secret: String! @isUnique
#   size: Int!
#   updatedAt: DateTime!
#   url: String! @isUnique
# }

# All types need to have an id field defined like this:

# type User implements Node {
#   id: ID! @isUnique
# }
